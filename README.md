# Movie-List
# Allows for you to add a movie to a list and mark it as done as well as clear a movie from the list. This code also allows for you to organize the list in alphabetical order
#The code will ask you to choose from options 1-8 all with different functions and then ask you what you want to add or delete based on the option you chose
#My partner for this code was: Kiara Jordan
